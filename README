			 October Chess Engine

This is a rather simple Chess engine, written in Java, initially
developed in October 2010. It can be run standalone, or as an
applet. It's multi-threaded and will make good use of a multi-core
machine. Right now it can search 6 plies on modern hardware pretty
quickly, and 8 plies is still reasonable on good hardware.

The engine configuration could definitely use some tweaking, and a
non-developer could do it easily. Just find this properties file and
edit to taste,
